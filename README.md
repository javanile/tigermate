# Tigermate

**Tigermate** is a fork of Vtiger 7.4 created to experiment with architectural changes, refactoring strategies, and evolutionary improvements.

> ⚠️ **Not for production use**
> Tigermate is **not** intended to be a production-ready CRM.
> It is a sandbox for testing ideas, validating concepts, and exploring alternative technical directions.

## Purpose

* Experiment with refactoring techniques
* Explore language and structural evolutions
* Test cloud-native and modularization approaches
* Validate long-term maintainability strategies

This repository is intentionally unstable and subject to heavy changes.
